## Transforming loan data into actionable business insights through cloud-native analytics architecture

### Project Overview

The ECommerce Analytics Dashboard represents a comprehensive data analytics solution built on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for a fintech organization. This project demonstrates how modern cloud technologies can transform raw loan data into actionable business intelligence, enabling data-driven decision making across financial services operations.

**Live Demo:** [https://kkebaara.github.io/DataAnalystPortfolio/index.html](https://kkebaara.github.io/DataAnalystPortfolio/index.html)

### Business Challenge

Financial institutions generate massive volumes of loan data across multiple systems and touchpoints. The challenge lies not in data collection, but in transforming this disparate information into coherent, actionable insights that can drive business strategy and risk management decisions.

Our client faced several critical challenges:

- **Data Fragmentation**: Loan information scattered across multiple systems and storage formats
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Slow query performance hindering real-time decision making
- **Manual Reporting**: Time-intensive manual processes for generating stakeholder reports
- **Limited Accessibility**: Data insights confined to technical teams rather than business stakeholders

### Technical Architecture

#### Cloud Infrastructure Stack

**Data Storage**: Google Cloud Storage for raw data ingestion and BigQuery for structured analytics

**Data Processing**: Advanced SQL transformations with Create Table As Select (CTAS) optimization

**Visualization**: Google Looker for interactive dashboard development

**Performance Optimization**: Materialized views and strategic data partitioning

#### Data Pipeline Architecture

The solution implements a modern Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline designed for scalability and real-time analytics:

```sql
-- Example CTAS optimization for loan performance analytics
CREATE TABLE `project.dataset.loan_performance_optimized` AS
SELECT 
  loan_id,
  borrower_id,
  loan_amount,
  interest_rate,
  loan_status,
  origination_date,
  risk_score,
  -- Performance metrics calculations
  CASE 
    WHEN payment_history_score >= 750 THEN 'Low Risk'
    WHEN payment_history_score >= 650 THEN 'Medium Risk'
    ELSE 'High Risk'
  END AS risk_category,
  
  -- Time-based aggregations for trend analysis
  DATE_TRUNC(origination_date, MONTH) as origination_month,
  
  -- Calculated fields for dashboard KPIs
  ROUND(loan_amount * interest_rate / 100, 2) as annual_interest_amount
  
FROM `project.dataset.raw_loan_data`
WHERE loan_status IS NOT NULL
  AND origination_date >= '2020-01-01'
CLUSTER BY loan_status, risk_category;
```

### Key Features & Implementation

#### 4. Advanced Interactive Features

**Cross-Filtering Capabilities**: Implemented dynamic filtering allowing users to drill down from portfolio-level metrics to individual loan analysis.

**Automated Refresh**: Configured scheduled data refreshes ensuring stakeholders always access current information.

**Conditional Formatting**: Applied visual indicators highlighting critical thresholds and alert conditions:

```sql
-- Example conditional logic for dashboard alerts
SELECT 
  loan_id,
  borrower_name,
  days_overdue,
  CASE 
    WHEN days_overdue >= 90 THEN 'Critical'
    WHEN days_overdue >= 30 THEN 'Warning'
    ELSE 'Normal'
  END as alert_status,
  -- Color coding for dashboard visualization
  CASE 
    WHEN days_overdue >= 90 THEN '#FF4444'  -- Red
    WHEN days_overdue >= 30 THEN '#FFA500'  -- Orange
    ELSE '#00AA00'                          -- Green
  END as status_color
FROM loan_monitoring_view
WHERE loan_status = 'Active';
```

    loan_amount,
    -- Portfolio context for individual loans
    AVG(risk_score) OVER (
      PARTITION BY DATE_TRUNC(origination_date, QUARTER)
    ) as quarterly_avg_risk,
    
    -- Percentile ranking for comparative analysis
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER (
      ORDER BY risk_score
    ) as risk_percentile,
    
    -- Running totals for cumulative analysis
    SUM(loan_amount) OVER (
