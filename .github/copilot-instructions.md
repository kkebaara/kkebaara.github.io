# Copilot Instructions for Kenneth Kebaara's Portfolio Website

## Architecture Overview

This is a Jekyll-based portfolio website hosted on GitHub Pages with a custom domain (kebaara.com). The site uses Semantic UI for styling and follows a component-based architecture through Jekyll's includes and layouts system.

### Core Structure
- **`_data/bio.json`**: Single source of truth for all personal/professional data - edit this instead of hardcoding content
- **`_config.yml`**: Controls theming, Medium integration, SEO settings, and Jekyll configuration
- **`_includes/`**: Reusable HTML components, including theme variations (e.g., `theme-home-builtin-1.html`)
- **`_layouts/`**: Page templates that wrap content with includes
- **Collections**: Projects and essays are Jekyll collections with permalinks and front matter

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
```bash
bundle install          # Install dependencies
bundle exec jekyll serve # Start development server
```

### Content Publishing
1. **Projects**: Create `.md` files in `/projects/` with front matter (`layout: project`, `published: true/false`)
2. **Essays**: Create `.md` files in `/essays/` with date format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
3. **Bio Updates**: Edit `_data/bio.json` - this populates all bio sections site-wide

## Key Patterns & Conventions

### Theming System
- Themes are modular includes (e.g., `theme-home-builtin-1.html`, `theme-projects-builtin-1.html`)
- Configure themes in `_config.yml` under `theme-home`, `theme-projects`, etc.
- New themes should follow the `theme-{section}-{variant}.html` naming pattern

### Front Matter Standards
```yaml
---
layout: project|essay
type: project|essay
published: true|false    # Controls visibility
date: YYYY-MM-DD        # Required for proper sorting
labels: [tag1, tag2]    # For filtering and display
image: images/file.png  # Relative to site root
permalink: /path/       # Custom URL structure
---
```

### Medium Integration
- Configured in `_config.yml` with username and article limits
- Uses RSS2JSON API to fetch articles dynamically
- Integrated into home page theme variations

### SEO & Performance
- Uses `jekyll-seo-tag` plugin for meta tags
- Custom sitemap configuration excludes build files
- Performance monitoring via `js/performance-monitor.js`
- Canonical redirects handled by `js/canonical-redirect.js`
- Testimonials use `ProfessionalService` schema for proper structured data (not `Person` which doesn't support reviews)

## File Organization Rules

### Images
- Project images: `/images/project-name/`
- Profile pictures: `/images/` (referenced in bio.json)
- Use descriptive, kebab-case filenames

### Styling
- Main customizations: `css/stylesheet-customizations.scss`
- Print styles: `css/print-customizations.scss`
- Semantic UI components: `css/semantic-ui/`
- Always include YAML front matter in SCSS files for Jekyll processing

### JavaScript
- Site enhancements: `js/site-enhancements.js` (theme toggle, search)
- Semantic UI initialization in layout files
- External integrations as separate modules

## Common Tasks

### Adding New Project
1. Create `projects/project-name.md` with proper front matter
2. Add images to `/images/` directory
3. Use Semantic UI classes for styling (`ui small rounded images`)
4. Set `published: true` when ready

### Updating Bio Information
- Edit `_data/bio.json` - this is the single source for all personal data
- Follows JSON Resume schema structure
- Changes automatically propagate to all bio sections

### Theme Customization
- Copy existing theme include (e.g., `theme-home-builtin-1.html`)
- Rename following convention and update `_config.yml`
- Use Semantic UI classes for consistent styling

### SEO Updates
- Update `_config.yml` for site-wide SEO (title, description, keywords)
- Individual pages inherit from front matter
- Structured data automatically generated by jekyll-seo-tag

- Jekyll 3.9.0 (GitHub Pages compatible)
