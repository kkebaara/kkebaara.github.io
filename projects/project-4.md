U2K is a web application that we built that gives users a US mailing address when they sign up. It allows them to shop US discounts online and recieving their purchases internationally.

U2K is implemented using [Ruby On Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) framework appliation. It took a few months to develop and went live as a functional business. Through online marketing we were able to target marketing and get customers. 


In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including PostgreSQL (https://www.postgresql.org/) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface. I also learnt how to implement [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for different applications to accept payments.
